# SkillSwap – Teach What You Know, Learn What You Don’t

SkillSwap is a simple web app that connects people who want to **teach** a skill with those who want to **learn** one.

Built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**, this project allows users to post skills they can teach or learn, view others’ skill listings, and grow through peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.
